# Authentication

The Relayer uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## API Key Format

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the following format:

```
Authorization: ApiKey <your_api_key>
```

## Getting an API Key

To get an API key:

1. Contact your Relayer administrator
2. Provide your use case and requirements
3. Receive your API key (store it securely!)

## Using Your API Key

Include the API key in all requests:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X GET https://api.relayer.fi/v1/metadata/types \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript
fetch('https://api.relayer.fi/v1/metadata/types', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'ApiKey your_api_key_here'
  }
})
```

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'ApiKey your_api_key_here'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.relayer.fi/v1/metadata/types',
    headers=headers
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**Never commit API keys** to version control or share them publicly.
</Warning>

- **Use environment variables** to store API keys
- **Rotate keys** regularly
- **Don't share** API keys in public forums or support tickets
- **Use different keys** for development and production environments

## API Key Scopes

Different API keys have different scopes and permissions:

- **Admin Keys**: Full access to all endpoints
- **Internal Keys**: Access to internal endpoints
- **Integrator Keys**: Access to integrator-specific endpoints
- **Client Keys**: Limited access for specific integrators

Contact your administrator to determine which type of key you need.
